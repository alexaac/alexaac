Hi! I'm Cristina, a freelance data visualization developer, working from Cluj-Napoca, România.

During the last 3 years, I have developed various projects using mostly JavaScript. Before than I have worked as a cartographer for 3 years, then as a full-stack developer/web mapping for almost 10 years.

I am focused mostly on storytelling, 3D & interactive maps, data visualizations and animations.
Besides creating visualizations for the web, I love to perform GIS analysis on open-source data, and 3D terrain analysis on LiDAR derived images.

Also, I create web design systems, handle web development & integration for my projects, and manage web hosting for them.

Feel free to check out examples of my projects on my personal webiste, [maptheclouds.com](https://maptheclouds.com)

One of my ongoing projects is [DatavizRomania](https://datavizromania.org/). I have started it to record my journey of learning data visualization and share it with the data visualization community in România.

If you're interested in my projects & experiments, please feel free to [contact me](https://maptheclouds.com/about.html) to find out how we might work together.
